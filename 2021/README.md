# Advent of code 2021

My goal for 2021 is to use as many programming languages as I can.

## How to run

To run these programs you require docker, docker-compose and make to be installed on your machine.

You can eiter run a single day solution like
```
make day01
```
or run all days by running
```
make all
```

## Language list

Ideally I would use a differnet one each day. Here is a list of programming languages roughly
sorted from what I understand most to least.

- [ ] Python
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Javascript/Typescript
- [ ] C++
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] C
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Bash
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Perl
- [ ] Swift
- [ ] Matlab/Julia/GNU Octave
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] C#
- [ ] Pascal
- [x] Excel
- [ ] R
- [ ] Dart
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] SQL
- [x] LOLCODE
- [x] Shakespeare

## Code Golf
For some problems I also made a as short as possible solution in python. Stored in `golf` folder.
```
python3 golf/day01.py < input/day01.txt
```
